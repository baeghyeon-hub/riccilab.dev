// Mirror of src/minimize.rs (serde JSON shape). Stage 5 takes the
// Stage 3 subset-construction DFA, totalizes it against an implicit
// dead sink, and runs Hopcroft partition refinement. Each step is one
// (splitter, symbol) pair that caused at least one block to split.
//
// Sink semantics — must match the Rust module docstring:
// - Missing transitions in the source DFA are treated as going to a
//   sink state. Sink's id is `sink_id = source_dfa_states.length`.
// - Every partition / block / mapping entry in this trace references
//   ids in `0..=sink_id`.
// - `minimized.sink_block` tells the viewer which minimized state to
//   hide (or render dashed) and which incoming transitions to drop.
//
